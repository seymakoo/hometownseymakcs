                <p>Istanbul is one of the world’s most fascinating cities,
                    rich in history and geography. Located at the crossroads 
                    of Asia and Europe, the city reflects both Eastern and
                     Western influences. This unique position has made Istanbul 
                     a cultural mosaic, where the legacies of the Byzantine,
                      Ottoman, and modern Turkish eras are felt in every corner.</p>
